How to subdivide this project?
    Four people write sections, fifth person writes intro/conclusion
     and ties stuff together.

    Intro/Motivation/Background:
        Currently a young and hot area of research.
        Previous work and current state of the art at a high level of
         abstraction.
    Possible sections:
        1. Theory of DNA Computation
            Technical details of implementing a Turing Machine w/ DNA.
            Unlike w/ quantum computing, DNA computing offers no opportunity
             to move any problems from some complexity class to an easier class
             (e.g. problems that are NP-Complete on a classical computer are not
             in P on a DNA computer).
        2. How practical is DNA computation?
            Is it fast?
            Is it as cost-effectuve to streamline and mass manufacture as
             classical computers?
            Is DNA computation energy efficient?
            How well does DNA memory work. Is it scalable?
        3. What could DNA computers offer in the future that regular computers
           cannot?
            Exploits massive parallelization.
            Possibility for ultra high density storage media.
            Low power consumption
        4. Possible applications to chemical circuitry for interacting with
            biological models. Molecular robotics. Nanoscale computing.
            Cancer diagnosis.
        5. Are there already simulators for DNA computation available? If
            there are, would it be feasible for us to run a demonstration on
            one? Would it be feasible for us to make such a simulator?
