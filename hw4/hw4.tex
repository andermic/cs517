\section{}
One way to do this is to compress the input string into a string that uses a
larger internal working alphabet.
As an example, suppose that $K = 4$ and $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$. Now let
$\Gamma = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F\}$, to allow conversion of binary
input strings into a hexadecimal internal representation. Now instead of taking
four steps to operate on each group of four bits, take one step to operate on
each hex digit. For arbitrary values of $K$ and $|\Sigma|$, make
$|\Gamma| = K^{|\Sigma|}$, so that $K$-strings of symbols in $\Sigma$ can be
represented as a single symbol in $\Gamma$. 

\vspace{1em}

Modern computer architecture operates in this fashion. Even though we normally
think of digital data as a series of bits, modern CPUs perform computations on
32 or 64 bits in parallel, allowing a 32x or 64x speedup for large operands.

\vspace{1em}

In the computer architecture world, this parallelism is accomplished by simply
having enough hardware to process all of the bits at once. In
the Turing Machine world, for each symbol in $\Gamma$ create a set of rules
that is analogous to the all of the computation that would be performed on
its corresponding $K$-string of $\Sigma$.

\section{}
The number of strings over $\Sigma^*$ is a countable infinity. This can be
demonstrated by simply listing them in some "alphabetical" order, and numbering
them by this order. For example if $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$, we could have
$0 \leftrightarrow \epsilon, 1 \leftrightarrow a, 2 \leftrightarrow b,
3 \leftrightarrow aa, 4 \leftrightarrow ab, 5 \leftrightarrow ba, \ldots$

\vspace{1em}

The number of sets over $\Sigma^*$, however, is an uncountable infinity. Since
each such set is a subset of
$\Sigma^*$, there are $2^{\Sigma^*}$ such subsets. By Cantor's Theorem, the
powerset of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set.

\vspace{1em}

As was demonstrated in class, there are only a countably infinite number of 
programs, and therefore a countably infinite number of possible Turing Machines.
Every stored program is stored as a sequence of bits, and any sequence of bits
can be interpreted as some natural number (with the proviso of prepending a 1
to resolve the ambiguity of leading zeroes).

\vspace{1em}

Since the number of sets over $\Sigma^*$ is an uncountable infinity, and the
number of Turing Machines is a countable infinity, by the diagonalization
argument there exist sets over $\Sigma^*$ which cannot be accepted by a Turing
Machine.

\section{}
All algebraic numbers are computable. Numerical algorithms such as bisection and
Newton's method for root-finding compute the value of the root of any
polynomial with rational coefficients to any arbitrarily high degree of
accuracy.

\vspace{1em}

Not all computable numbers are algebraic. Non-algebraic numbers such as $\pi$
and $e$ (we can say $\pi/4$ or $e/3$ to get them into the interval (0,1)) can be
represented as convergent series with computable terms, and computed
to any arbitrarily high degree of accuracy.

\vspace{1em}

Successively applying pairing functions gives us that rational numbers are
countable, and polynomials with rational coefficients are countable.
Furthermore, since each polynomial has only a finite number of real roots, the
real roots of polynomials with rational coefficients are also countable.

\vspace{1em}

From problem (4) there are only a countable number of Turing Machines, and it is
given that every computable number has a corresponding Turing Machine that
generates it to any degree of accuracy, so the computable numbers are also
countable.

\vspace{1em}

Since there are a countably infinite number of both algebraic and computable
numbers, these sets are the same size.

\section{}

$S$ is in Recursive iff it has a recognizer, so show that a recognizer for $S$
can be used to make a strong generator $GEN_S(n)$ such that
$\forall n \hspace{4pt} GEN_S(n) < GEN_S(n + 1)$, and vice versa.

\vspace{1em}

From the notes, given a recognizer for $S$ we can make a monotically increasing
strong generator by identifying members of $S$ with the recognizer and not
outputting any previously outputted member of $S$:

\[
GEN_S(n) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{l l}
        n &  \text{if $Rec_S$ = YES and $n \notin \{Gen_S(0),\ldots,Gen_S(n-1)$\}} \\
        GEN_S(n+1) & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{array} \right.
\]

Now given a monotonically increasing strong generator $GEN_S(n)$ for $S$, we can
build a recognizer $Rec_S(n)$ for $S$ by feeding the natural numbers into 
$GEN_S$ until we generate a value that is either larger than $n$ or equal to
$n$:

\begin{verbatim}
RecS(n)
    FOR EACH i in {0,1,2,3,...}
        IF GenS(i) = n
            RETURN(YES)
        IF GenS(i) > n
            RETURN(NO)
\end{verbatim}
