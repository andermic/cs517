Have transition function (Lamdba) -> (Lambda) x (Movement or Write)

Make (Lambda) = (Sigma) x (Q) in quintuple

Reading the tape tells me what state I'm in, along with the Sigma.



Have Q x Sigma -> Action

Where action is one of: change state, write symbol, move.

1. Read symbol on tape -> write encoded symbol to write on tape, and next state, and movement.

2. Read encoded symbol -> Transition to q_(write symbol, movement)

3. Read encoded symbol in q', since it contains q' ... -> Write encoded
symbol for write symbol and movement

4. Read encoded symbol -> output write symbol

5. Read write symbol -> move accordingly
